Latest Sonus tv Update: 2017-08-04

-Couldnt wait for Elysium to be Fixed in an auto update, so I went ahead and fixed it myself.

-This isn't a necessary update but, if you want to use The MAIN "Movies" section or Elysium Tv then I suggest you do so.

-Also removed the Pair links from Elysium and Added fisherman's Cove RELOADED to Extras!
